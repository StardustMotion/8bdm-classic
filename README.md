aims to be a modular base which recreates the classic player versus robot master experience of 2D Megaman, but in Megaman 8-Bit deathmatch, and with an additional MMO touch, as you can play up to 8 players in PvM levels and with a rank (level) progression.

Still very prototype/engine construction phase
